DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting house prices in Bangalore based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, age of the property, and total rooms. A synthetic dataset was generated to simulate real-world Bangalore housing data, incorporating realistic ranges and some outliers to mirror real life scenarios. The pipeline includes data cleaning (handling missing values and removing outliers), feature engineering (like total rooms and price per square foot), model training using a Random Forest Regressor, and evaluation using Mean Squared Error. The model is then integrated into an interactive and user-friendly Streamlit web application that allows users to input house features and receive a predicted price in INR lakhs. The app is fully deployable on Streamlit Community Cloud, making it accessible to anyone. This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow from data preprocessing and model building to deployment using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, and is a great reference for beginners or intermediate learners working on regression tasks or real estate analytics.
