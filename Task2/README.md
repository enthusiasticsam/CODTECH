This deep learning project focuses on building an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 color images categorized into 10 different classes, including airplanes, cars, dogs, and cats. The primary objective is to develop a functional model capable of classifying unseen images with high accuracy. The dataset is preprocessed by normalizing pixel values to improve convergence during training. The CNN architecture includes multiple convolutional layers to extract key image features, max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers to perform classification. The final output layer uses the softmax activation function to predict the probability of each image belonging to one of the ten classes. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, ensuring efficient training and optimization. Training is conducted over ten epochs, with both training and validation accuracies being tracked to monitor performance. The results show a steady increase in training accuracy, reaching 84.79%, while the validation accuracy stabilizes at 70.19%, demonstrating good generalization to new data. Additionally, predictions are visualized using Matplotlib, displaying sample test images alongside their predicted labels. This project highlights the potential of deep learning for image classification tasks, with applications in various fields such as autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and security systems. Future improvements could include data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and leveraging pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG16 to enhance accuracy further. Overall, this project serves as a foundational implementation of deep learning-based image classification, demonstrating how CNNs can be effectively applied to real-world problems.
