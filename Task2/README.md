This project centers around developing an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely used benchmark in machine learning that consists of 60,000 color images divided into 10 distinct classes: airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. Each image is 32x32 pixels in size and comes with a single label indicating its class. The main goal of this project is to create a deep learning model capable of recognizing and classifying these images accurately, even when faced with unseen data.

The process begins with data preprocessing, which includes normalizing the image pixel values to a range between 0 and 1. This step is crucial for improving training efficiency and ensuring consistent gradients during backpropagation. The model architecture is built using several convolutional layers to automatically extract important features from the images, such as edges, textures, and shapes. These layers are paired with ReLU activation functions to introduce non-linearity and enhance learning capacity. Max-pooling layers are added to downsample the feature maps, reducing computational complexity while preserving important spatial information.

To mitigate overfitting, dropout layers are incorporated, randomly deactivating neurons during training to encourage the model to learn more robust patterns. The extracted features are then passed through fully connected (dense) layers, which interpret them and make final predictions. A softmax activation function is used in the output layer to generate a probability distribution over the 10 classes.

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and trained with sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. Training is carried out over 10 epochs, and both training and validation accuracy are tracked throughout to monitor the model’s performance. After training, the model achieves an accuracy of approximately 84.79% on the training data and 70.19% on the validation data, indicating good generalization to unseen inputs. Sample predictions are visualized using Matplotlib, showcasing test images along with their predicted class labels.

While the model performs reasonably well, there’s room for improvement. Future enhancements may include data augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping to expose the model to more varied data. Additionally, tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, or the number of layers can help improve results. Transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet50 or VGG16 could also be leveraged for more accurate predictions with fewer training epochs.

This project demonstrates a complete deep learning workflow, from preprocessing and model design to evaluation and visualization. It serves as a solid introduction to CNNs and image classification, and it lays the groundwork for more advanced projects in computer vision. Whether you're a beginner in deep learning or exploring practical applications of neural networks, this project offers valuable insights into building real-world AI models.
