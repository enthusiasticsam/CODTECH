# CODTECH DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP

This repository contains four diverse and practical projects completed as part of the CodTech internship, showcasing key concepts in data engineering, deep learning, machine learning, and optimization. Each task addresses a unique problem domain and collectively demonstrates a well-rounded skill set across the data science pipeline using tools like Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PuLP, and Streamlit.

Task 1: Data Pipeline Development focuses on the foundational process of building a structured and reliable data pipeline. The goal is to prepare raw data into a clean and usable format through various preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, outlier detection, feature engineering, and data transformation. This task emphasizes the importance of data quality and structure in any machine learning or analytics workflow. It showcases the practical steps that make raw data suitable for downstream tasks like modeling and visualization.

Task 2: Deep Learning Project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and includes essential components like convolutional layers, ReLU activations, max-pooling, dropout for regularization, and a softmax output layer for multi-class classification. The model achieves strong training and validation accuracy, and predictions are visualized using Matplotlib. This project is a hands-on demonstration of how CNNs learn to extract features from images and perform real-world classification tasks, laying the groundwork for advanced computer vision applications.

Task 3: End-to-End Data Science Project is a full machine learning workflow focused on predicting house prices in Bangalore. Since public datasets for this use case are limited, a synthetic dataset was generated to mimic realistic property listings. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training using Random Forest Regressor, and evaluation using mean squared error. To make the solution interactive and accessible, the model is deployed using a Streamlit web application where users can input housing details and receive predicted prices in INR lakhs. This task exemplifies how to build, test, and deploy a data science solution from scratch.

Task 4: Optimization Model presents a linear programming solution using the PuLP library to maximize profit for a company producing two products under material and labor constraints. Decision variables represent the quantity of each product, and the model finds the optimal production plan that maximizes total profit. This project demonstrates how mathematical optimization can guide business decisions and efficiently allocate limited resources.

Overall, this CodTech repository covers a rich variety of applied data science topics—from the foundations of data engineering and deep learning to complete machine learning solutions and optimization. Each task is structured to be beginner-friendly while also demonstrating real-world relevance. Whether you’re looking to explore data pipelines, improve image classification skills, deploy predictive models, or solve resource allocation problems using linear programming, this collection serves as a comprehensive portfolio for aspiring data professionals.
